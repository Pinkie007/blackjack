<h2>The blackjack rules</h2>
<p class="rules">
 
A dealer competes against a variable number of players and every player competes only against the dealer.<br>

The object of the game is beat the dealer.<br>
Every player can ask cards to the dealer in order to obtain 21 and he can pass the turn when he wants.<br>
If a player exceeds 21, he’s busting and the dealer wins.<br>
Once the player passes the turn is the dealer’s turn.<br>
The dealer can draw all the cards he wants in order to surpass the player score.<br>
If the dealer exceeds 21, he’s busting and the player wins.<br>
If there is a tie, the dealer wins.<br>

The face cards (jacks, queens, kings) are worth 10, any other card is worth its own number.<br>
The ace can be calculated as 1 or 11, the calculation is based on the cards on the table, so asking cards it’s possible to recalculate any ace as 1 instead of 11, in order not going to bust.
